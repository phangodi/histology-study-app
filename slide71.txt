  functionalContext: "Peripheral nerves transmit electrical signals bidirectionally between the CNS and body periphery. Motor axons carry efferent signals from CNS to muscles/glands. Sensory axons carry afferent signals from receptors to CNS. The three-layered connective tissue wrapping provides mechanical protection, vascular supply (vasa nervorum in epineurium), and barrier function (blood-nerve barrier in perineurium). The wavy configuration in longitudinal sections allows nerves to stretch up to 15-20% during limb movement without damage. Myelin sheaths (produced by Schwann cells) enable saltatory conduction, increasing conduction velocity 10-100×. Nodes of Ranvier (visible in longitudinal sections) are gaps where action potentials are regenerated.",

      condition: "Guillain-Barré Syndrome",
      relevance: "Autoimmune demyelination of peripheral nerves. Immune system attacks myelin sheaths (produced by Schwann cells), stripping myelin from axons. This eliminates saltatory conduction, causing progressive ascending weakness. In histology, would see loss of myelin (fewer white spaces), exposed axons, and inflammatory infiltrate in endoneurium. Recovery occurs as Schwann cells regenerate myelin."
    },
    {
      condition: "Peripheral Neuropathy (Diabetic)",
      relevance: "Chronic hyperglycemia damages both axons and microvasculature. Disrupts blood-nerve barrier function in perineurium, leading to nerve fiber degeneration. Affects endoneurial capillaries (vasa nervorum), causing ischemia. In histology, would see axon loss, myelin degeneration, thickened perineurium, and reduced nerve fiber density. Length-dependent pattern (longest nerves affected first) due to metabolic demands."
    },
    {
      condition: "Nerve Transection and Regeneration",
      relevance: "When peripheral nerves are cut, axons distal to injury undergo Wallerian degeneration (axon and myelin breakdown). Schwann cells proliferate and form regeneration tubes (bands of Büngner) to guide regrowing axons. In longitudinal sections, would see disrupted fiber continuity, Schwann cell proliferation, and eventually regenerating axon sprouts growing through Schwann tubes. The endoneurium provides the scaffold for regeneration. PNS can regenerate (unlike CNS) because Schwann cells support regrowth."
    },
    {
      condition: "Carpal Tunnel Syndrome",
      relevance: "Chronic compression of median nerve at wrist. Sustained pressure damages perineurium barrier function and compromises endoneurial blood flow, causing ischemia. In histology, would see nerve fiber compression, myelin degradation, and fibrosis of connective tissue layers. The epineurium becomes thickened and fibrotic. Demonstrates importance of mechanical protection by CT layers."
    },
    {
      condition: "Leprosy (Hansen's Disease)",
      relevance: "Mycobacterium leprae specifically infects Schwann cells in peripheral nerves, causing demyelination and sensory loss. Bacteria have tropism for cooler body areas and Schwann cells. In histology, would see Schwann cells packed with acid-fast bacilli, myelin loss, and granulomatous inflammation in perineurium and epineurium. One of the few bacterial infections targeting Schwann cells specifically."

  identificationTips: [
    "FIRST: Look for the wavy pattern - this immediately confirms longitudinal section (vs honeycomb in cross section)",
    "SECOND: Identify fascicles by finding the pink perineurium border running longitudinally along bundle edges",
    "THIRD: Within fascicles, look for the repeating pattern: pink axon strand flanked by white linear myelin spaces",
    "FOURTH: Distinguish the three CT layers: thin barely-visible endoneurium between fibers, distinct pink perineurium rim around fascicles, thick epineurium with adipocytes outside fascicles",
    "Look for elongated Schwann nuclei aligned along myelin sheaths - these confirm you're seeing nerve fibers",
    "Scan for Nodes of Ranvier: brief interruptions in the linear myelin pattern where myelin is absent",
    "Large white spaces outside fascicles = adipocytes (3-10× bigger than myelin, in epineurium)",
    "Small uniform white linear spaces inside fascicles with central pink strand = myelin (in fascicles)",
    "If you see BLACK myelin instead of white spaces, you're looking at OsOâ‚„ stain (Slide 73), not HE!",
    "The wavy fiber pattern may vary in degree - more pronounced in relaxed nerves, less in stretched nerves",
    "Use the mnemonic 'WAVY = LONGITUDINAL, HONEYCOMB = CROSS' to instantly orient yourself",
    "Count fascicles by counting perineurium-bounded bundles - most nerves have multiple fascicles"

  examTips: [
    "Exam images often compare longitudinal vs cross sections of the same nerve - know the diagnostic differences!",
    "WAVY PATTERN is the #1 giveaway for longitudinal sections - mention this in your answer",
    "Remember: HE myelin = WHITE (negative image), OsOâ‚„ myelin = BLACK (positive staining)",
    "Be able to identify all three CT layers and state their CNS equivalents: ENDO=Pia, PERI=Arachnoid, EPI=Dura",
    "Know the blood-nerve barrier location (perineurium tight junctions) and its function",
    "Distinguish myelin from adipocytes using SIZE (adipocytes 3-10× bigger) and LOCATION (inside vs outside fascicles)",
    "Be prepared to identify Nodes of Ranvier in longitudinal sections (not visible in cross sections)",
    "Understand the hierarchical organization: axon â†' fascicle â†' nerve trunk",
    "Know clinical correlations: Guillain-Barré (demyelination), diabetic neuropathy (axon + vascular damage), nerve regeneration (Schwann cell role)",
    "If asked about conduction velocity, relate it to myelin presence (saltatory conduction is 10-100× faster)",
    "Be ready to explain WHY nerves are wavy (protective reserve length for stretching during movement)",
    "Remember that Schwann cells produce myelin in PNS (oligodendrocytes in CNS) - each Schwann cell myelinates ONE internode",
    "For structure-function questions: relate CT layers to protection, perineurium to blood-nerve barrier, myelin to conduction speed",
    "Longitudinal sections show fiber LENGTH and CONTINUITY; cross sections show ORGANIZATION and allow fiber COUNTING"
