# MASTER PROMPT: Histology Slide Content Generation v4.0
**Updated for 3-format study app (Hierarchical, Quick Cards, Relationships)**
**Last Updated:** October 21, 2025

---

## üìã OBJECTIVE

Generate a complete JavaScript object for a histology slide with comprehensive exam-ready content optimized for 3 study formats:
1. **Hierarchical** - Complete learning format with numbered cards, nested structures, all fields displayed
2. **Quick Cards** - Clean flashcards with white backgrounds, black text, no emojis
3. **Relationships** - Spatial organization and functional connections

**NOTE:** Ultra-Minimal format has been **DISABLED**. Do NOT generate Ultra-Minimal content.

## üö® CRITICAL: MEDICAL ACCURACY FIRST, SCHOOL'S LIST AS CHECKLIST

**‚öïÔ∏è PRIORITY #1: Generate medically accurate, educationally complete content**

**The school's essential list is a STUDY CHECKLIST for exams, NOT a limitation on educational content!**

### **YOU MUST:**
1. **Generate medically accurate structures** with correct anatomical relationships
   - Nissl bodies ARE IN perikaryon cytoplasm ‚Üí nest them inside!
   - Pseudounipolar neurons HAVE bifurcating processes ‚Üí include them!
   - Include all functionally relevant structures

2. **Use school's list as CHECKLIST** to ensure exam essentials are present
   - Cross-check all items from official list are included
   - Ensure students can identify required structures
   - Match general organization (grouped/layers/additional)

3. **Add educational value** beyond the minimal list
   - Functional subdivisions (peripheral/central processes)
   - Clinical correlations (disrupted in MS, etc.)
   - Supporting structures (blood vessels, capsule)

### **Example: Peripheral Nerve Slides**
**School's List (exam checklist):**
1. Bundle of Nerve Fibers
2. Endoneurium
3. Perineurium
4. Epineurium
5. Fibrocytes

**Your Complete Data (medical accuracy + educational value):**
1. Bundle (with nested: axon ‚Üí myelin ‚Üí node of Ranvier + clinical notes)
2. Endoneurium (with full details)
3. Perineurium (with full details)
4. Epineurium (with adipocytes as sublayer)
5. Fibrocytes (with function, appearance, location)
6. Blood vessels (supporting structure)

**KEY PRINCIPLE:** School's list shows WHAT to identify. Your data teaches WHY it matters and HOW it works!

## üìä EXAM ESSENTIALS DATA STRUCTURE

### **examEssentialStructures (MANDATORY)**

**Position:** Immediately after `stain` field, before `bigPicture`

```javascript
examEssentialStructures: {
  grouped: [{
    parent: "bundle of nerve fibers",
    where: "Inside each fascicle...",              // REQUIRED for Quick Cards
    appearance: "Honeycomb pattern...",            // REQUIRED for Quick Cards  
    function: "Conducts electrical impulses...",   // REQUIRED for Quick Cards
    quickID: "Look for honeycomb pattern...",      // REQUIRED for Quick Cards
    children: [
      // NEW NESTED FORMAT (supports infinite depth 6-8+ levels):
      {
        name: "axon",                              // REQUIRED
        description: "Central fiber...",           // REQUIRED
        relationship: "core of nerve fiber",       // OPTIONAL ‚Üí yellow badge
        clinicalNote: "Disrupted in neuropathy",   // OPTIONAL ‚Üí red box
        children: [                                // OPTIONAL ‚Üí recursive nesting
          {
            name: "myelin sheath",
            description: "Insulating layer...",
            children: [
              {
                name: "node of Ranvier",
                description: "Gaps between segments",
                relationship: "GAP in myelin sheath",
                clinicalNote: "Disrupted in MS, Guillain-Barr√©"
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      },
      // OLD FORMAT (backwards compatible):
      "axon", "myelin sheath", "Schwann cells"
    ]
  }],
  layers: ["endoneurium", "perineurium", "epineurium"],  // REQUIRED - order matters!
  additional: ["fibrocytes", "adipocytes"]                // OPTIONAL
}
```

**KEY POINTS:**
- `children` can be **strings** (simple) OR **objects** (nested with infinite depth)
- Object format: `{name, description, relationship, clinicalNote, children}`
- All formats detect type: `typeof child === 'object' && child.name`
- Hierarchical & Quick Cards use `RenderNestedStructure/RenderNestedChild` components
- **Order in layers array determines display numbering**

---

### **layers Array (ALL FIELDS DISPLAYED)**

```javascript
layers: [{
  name: "Endoneurium",                     // REQUIRED
  level: "Innermost layer (Level 1)",     // REQUIRED - shown in all formats
  wraps: "Individual nerve fiber",         // REQUIRED - shown in all formats
  appearance: "Very thin pink tissue...",  // REQUIRED - shown in all formats
  composition: "Delicate loose CT...",     // OPTIONAL - shown if present
  contains: "Capillaries, fibroblasts",    // OPTIONAL - shown if present
  function: "Provides microenvironment",   // OPTIONAL - shown if present
  quickID: "Thinnest pink layer...",       // OPTIONAL - shown if present
  cnsEquivalent: "Pia mater"               // OPTIONAL - shown in blue if present
}]
```

**CRITICAL:** ALL fields are displayed in Hierarchical and Quick Cards. **Nothing is hidden.**

---

### **aroundOrOutside Array (REQUIRED FOR ALL SLIDES)**

**üö® CRITICAL: This array is REQUIRED for ALL slides, not just peripheral nerve!**

```javascript
aroundOrOutside: [{
  structure: "Structure Name",                           // REQUIRED - must match item in examEssentialStructures.additional
  description: "Detailed visual appearance and characteristics",  // REQUIRED
  function: "Biological function",                       // REQUIRED
  spotIt: "Quick identification tip"                     // OPTIONAL - visual identification tip

  spotIt: "Quick identification tip"                     // OPTIONAL
}]
```

**Purpose:** Provides detailed information for structures listed in `examEssentialStructures.additional` that are located inside/within main components.

**Examples:**
- **Peripheral Nerve:** Fibrocytes (inside endoneurium)
- **Ganglia:** Nerve Fibers, Satellite Cells
- **Skin/Meissner's:** Peripheral Nerves (coursing through tissue)

### **3. RELATIONSHIPS FORMAT**

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: ADAPTIVE TO TISSUE TYPE - NOT HARDCODED!**

The Relationships format **MUST detect tissue type and adapt** its display:

**Tissue Detection:**
```javascript
const isPeripheralNerve = data.examEssentialStructures.layers?.includes('endoneurium') || 
                           data.examEssentialStructures.layers?.includes('perineurium') || 
                           data.examEssentialStructures.layers?.includes('epineurium');
```

**For Peripheral Nerve:**
- Shows: "INSIDE FASCICLES" / "AROUND FASCICLES" / "OUTSIDE FASCICLES"

**For Other Tissues (Ganglia, CNS, Epithelium, etc.):**
- Shows: "MAIN COMPONENTS" / "SUPPORTING LAYERS" / "ADDITIONAL STRUCTURES"
- Recursively renders nested children with descriptions
- Pulls details from insideTheFascicles and aroundOrOutside arrays

**Section Order:**
1. Staining Context
2. EXAM ESSENTIALS - WHERE & HOW THEY RELATE (**ADAPTIVE** 3 colored boxes)
3. Nested Structure Visualization (concentric boxes)
4. Relationship Matrix Table
5. Size Comparison
6. Relationships Summary (optional)

**EXAM ESSENTIALS Section:**
- Three colored boxes (**ADAPTIVE** labels based on tissue type)
- Handles both string and object children gracefully
- Uses safe accessors (`safeVal`, `safe`)
- Recursively renders nested objects with infinite depth

**Data Requirements:**
- Uses `examEssentialStructures` for all content
- Falls back to `insideTheFascicles` for Bundle appearance if missing
- Uses `layers` array for layer details
- Uses `aroundOrOutside` for adipocytes
- **Works for ANY tissue type, not just peripheral nerve!**
