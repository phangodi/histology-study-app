## SLIDE 75: SENSORY NERVE ENDING - MEISSNER'S CORPUSCLE (Ag)
**Stain: Silver Stain**

### THE BIG PICTURE:
Meissner's corpuscles are touch receptors in dermal papillae of fingertips and lips. Silver stain shows their spiral nerve pattern. These give you fine touch discrimination.

### ESSENTIAL STRUCTURES:

**SKIN LAYERS:**

**1. Epidermis**
- **Stratified squamous keratinized epithelium**
- Multiple layers, surface keratinized

**2. Dermis - Stratum Papillare (Dermal Papillae)**
- Finger-like projections into epidermis
- **MEISSNER'S CORPUSCLE LOCATION**

**3. Meissner's Corpuscle**
- Small oval encapsulated receptor (30-75 × 50-150 μm)
- **Axon**: Black spiral/coiled nerve (silver-stained)
- Modified Schwann cells stack horizontally
- Thin connective tissue capsule

**4. Stratum Reticulare**
- Deeper dense dermis

**5. Hypodermis**
- Contains:
  - **Peripheral nerves**
  - **Vessels**

### EXAM SHORTCUTS:

**PATTERN:**
- Small oval + black spiral in dermal papilla = Meissner's
- Large onion rings in hypodermis = Pacinian

**LOCATION:**
- Superficial = light touch sensitivity
- High density: fingertips, lips, palms, soles

### CLINICAL PEARL:
Decreased two-point discrimination = Meissner's loss (aging, diabetes)

### STUDY TIP:
"Meissner's in papillae, spiral style" - small + superficial + coiled = light touch

## SLIDE 77: VEGETATIVE (AUTONOMIC) GANGLION (Ag)
**Stain: Silver Stain**

### THE BIG PICTURE:
Autonomic ganglia relay sympathetic/parasympathetic signals. Multipolar neurons with many dendrites. Silver stain shows processes like black spider webs.

### ESSENTIAL STRUCTURES:

**1. Multipolar Neurons**
- Irregularly shaped cell bodies
- Smaller than sensory neurons
- Multiple processes in all directions

**2. Perikaryon**
- Cell body

**3. Dendrites**
- Multiple black branching processes (silver-stained)
- Radiate from cell body
- Receive preganglionic input

**4. Nerve Fibers**
- Black axons throughout ganglion
- Preganglionic and postganglionic

**5. Nucleus**
- Large pale nucleus

**6. Nucleolus**
- Dark structure in nucleus

### EXAM SHORTCUTS:

**APPEARANCE:**
- "Spider neurons" with multiple BLACK arms
- Irregular shapes with radiating processes

**AUTONOMIC vs SENSORY:**
- Autonomic: MULTIPOLAR (many processes), smaller, irregular
- Sensory: PSEUDOUNIPOLAR (one splitting process), larger, round

### CLINICAL PEARL:
- Hirschsprung: No autonomic ganglia in colon → megacolon
- Chagas: Parasites destroy ganglia → megaesophagus

### STUDY TIP:
"Autonomic = many arms (MULTIpolar)" - many black processes = autonomic ganglion
