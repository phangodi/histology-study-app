# HISTOLOGY AUTOMATION GUIDE v2.0
**Complete guide for generating exam-ready histology slide content**

## üéØ PURPOSE
This guide enables automatic generation of comprehensive JavaScript objects for histology slides with 4 different presentation formats optimized for different study needs.

## üìã CRITICAL PRINCIPLES

### **Content Completeness Requirements:**
1. **Always include information beyond what's in project documents** - Use general histology knowledge to ensure exam readiness
2. **Mandatory inclusions for every slide:**
   - Complete staining information specific to that slide
   - All layers (if applicable)
   - CNS equivalents for nervous system structures
   - Size comparisons where relevant
   - Common identification mistakes
   - Spatial relationships (what wraps what, what's inside what)
   - High-yield exam points

3. **Layer slides MUST include all layers as essential structures:**
   - Peripheral nerve: Endoneurium, Perineurium, Epineurium
   - Skin: All 5 epidermal layers (Basale, Spinosum, Granulosum, Lucidum if present, Corneum)
   - Cerebral cortex: All 6 layers
   - Cerebellum: All 3 layers
   - Hippocampus: All 5 strata

## üîÑ AUTOMATION WORKFLOW

When user provides: **"Generate Slide [NUMBER]"**

### STEP 1: Extract from MTO PDF
Search School_s_essential_list_that_includes_all_the_slides_and_essential_structures_on_the_MTO_.pdf for:
- Slide number and name
- Stain type
- ALL structures listed (including sub-structures marked with hyphens)

### STEP 2: Find Relevant Files
Use OFFICIAL_MTO_DIRECTORY.md to identify which PDFs contain information about this slide.

### STEP 3: Search & Supplement
1. Search the relevant files for detailed information
2. **CRITICAL:** Supplement with general histology knowledge if:
   - Documents lack complete information
   - CNS equivalents not mentioned
   - Layer details incomplete
   - Staining mechanism not explained
   - Common mistakes not listed

### STEP 4: Generate Complete JavaScript Object
Output the complete object following the schema below.

## üé® THE 4 OUTPUT FORMATS

The JavaScript object contains ALL data. The React app renders it in 4 different ways:

### **1. HIERARCHICAL** (Primary study format)
- Big Picture section first
- Staining information prominently displayed
- Layers organized hierarchically (if applicable)
- Critical relationships section
- Clear visual hierarchy with color-coding
- **Use case:** Initial learning, comprehensive review

### **2. QUICK CARDS** (Flash card style)
- Staining as prominent card
- Each layer/structure as colorful card
- Key facts only, minimal text
- Emoji icons for visual memory
- 10-second test at end
- **Use case:** Rapid review, memorization

### **3. RELATIONSHIPS** (Connection-focused)
- Nested visual diagrams
- Relationship matrices/tables
- Size comparison charts
- Spatial organization emphasis
- CNS equivalents highlighted
- **Use case:** Understanding connections, spatial reasoning

### **4. ULTRA-MINIMAL** (Cramming format)
- Must-know facts only
- 5 key sections maximum
- One-sentence summaries
- 30-second drill
- No extra details
- **Use case:** Last-minute review, time pressure

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL RULES FOR CONTENT GENERATION

### **1. STAINING INFORMATION**
**MANDATORY for every slide:**
- Full technique name
- What it stains (general mechanism)
- **Specific to THIS slide:** What structures show what colors
- What the staining emphasizes in this particular preparation
- If HE: ALWAYS mention that lipids dissolve (myelin = white space, adipocytes = empty)

### **2. LAYERS (When Applicable)**
**If slide has layers, each layer MUST be in the `layers` array:**

**Peripheral Nerve (3 layers):**
- Endoneurium (wraps individual fibers, Pia equivalent)
- Perineurium (wraps fascicles, Arachnoid equivalent)
- Epineurium (wraps whole nerve, Dura equivalent)

**Skin (5 epidermal layers):**
- Stratum basale
- Stratum spinosum
- Stratum granulosum
- Stratum lucidum (only in thick skin!)
- Stratum corneum

**Cerebral Cortex (6 layers):**
- Molecular layer (I)
- External granular layer (II)
- External pyramidal layer (III)
- Internal granular layer (IV)
- Internal pyramidal layer (V)
- Multiform layer (VI)

**Cerebellum (3 layers):**
- Molecular layer
- Purkinje cell layer
- Granular layer

**Hippocampus (5 layers):**
- Str. moleculare
- Str. lacunosum
- Str. radiatum
- Str. pyramidale
- Str. oriens

### **3. CNS EQUIVALENTS (High-Yield!)**
**Always include for nervous system structures:**
- Nerve layers ‚Üí Meninges equivalents
- Note transition zones
- This is frequently tested!

### **4. SIZE COMPARISONS**
**Include when relevant:**
- Myelin spaces vs adipocytes (peripheral nerve)
- Cell body sizes (neurons in ganglia)
- Layer thicknesses (cerebral cortex)
- Any size-based identification

### **5. COMMON MISTAKES**
**Every structure MUST have at least 2 common mistakes:**
- What it's commonly confused with
- Why the confusion happens
- How to avoid the mistake

### **6. CRITICAL RELATIONSHIPS**
**MANDATORY section including:**
- Spatial relationships (what wraps what)
- Functional relationships
- CNS-PNS connections
- Comparisons with similar structures
- High-yield exam points
