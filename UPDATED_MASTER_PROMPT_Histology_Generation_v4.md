# MASTER PROMPT: Histology Slide Content Generation v4.0
**Updated for 3-format study app (Hierarchical, Quick Cards, Relationships)**
**Last Updated:** October 21, 2025

---

## üìã OBJECTIVE

Generate a complete JavaScript object for a histology slide with comprehensive exam-ready content optimized for 3 study formats:
1. **Hierarchical** - Complete learning format with numbered cards
2. **Quick Cards** - Clean flashcards for memorization
3. **Relationships** - Spatial organization and connections

---

## üö® CRITICAL: SCHOOL'S ESSENTIAL LIST STRUCTURE

**MANDATORY ORDER for all peripheral nerve slides:**
1. **Bundle of Nerve Fibers** (with nested children: axon ‚Üí myelin ‚Üí node of Ranvier)
2. **Endoneurium** 
3. **Perineurium**
4. **Epineurium** (with adipocytes as sublayer INSIDE)
5. **Fibrocytes**

This order reflects the school's official exam essential list and **MUST be followed exactly**.

## üìä EXAM ESSENTIALS DATA STRUCTURE

### **examEssentialStructures (MANDATORY)**

```javascript
examEssentialStructures: {
  grouped: [{
    parent: "bundle of nerve fibers",
    where: "Inside each fascicle...",              // REQUIRED for Quick Cards
    appearance: "Honeycomb pattern...",            // REQUIRED for Quick Cards  
    function: "Conducts electrical impulses...",   // REQUIRED for Quick Cards
    quickID: "Look for honeycomb pattern...",      // REQUIRED for Quick Cards
    children: [
      // NEW NESTED FORMAT (supports infinite depth 6-8+ levels):
      {
        name: "axon",                              // REQUIRED
        description: "Central fiber...",           // REQUIRED
        relationship: "core of nerve fiber",       // OPTIONAL ‚Üí yellow badge
        clinicalNote: "Disrupted in neuropathy",   // OPTIONAL ‚Üí red box
        children: [                                // OPTIONAL ‚Üí recursive nesting
          {
            name: "myelin sheath",
            description: "Insulating layer...",
            children: [
              {
                name: "node of Ranvier",
                description: "Gaps between segments",
                relationship: "GAP in myelin sheath",
                clinicalNote: "Disrupted in MS, Guillain-Barr√©"
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      },
      // OLD FORMAT (backwards compatible):
      "axon", "myelin sheath", "Schwann cells"
    ]
  }],
  layers: ["endoneurium", "perineurium", "epineurium"],  // REQUIRED - order matters!
  additional: ["fibrocytes", "adipocytes"]                // OPTIONAL
}
```

**KEY POINTS:**
- `children` can be **strings** (simple) OR **objects** (nested with infinite depth)
- Object format: `{name, description, relationship, clinicalNote, children}`
- All formats detect type: `typeof child === 'object' && child.name`
- Hierarchical & Quick Cards use `RenderNestedStructure/RenderNestedChild` components
- **Order in layers array determines display numbering**

---

### **layers Array (ALL FIELDS DISPLAYED)**

```javascript
layers: [{
  name: "Endoneurium",                     // REQUIRED
  level: "Innermost layer (Level 1)",     // REQUIRED - shown in all formats
  wraps: "Individual nerve fiber",         // REQUIRED - shown in all formats
  appearance: "Very thin pink tissue...",  // REQUIRED - shown in all formats
  composition: "Delicate loose CT...",     // OPTIONAL - shown if present
  contains: "Capillaries, fibroblasts",    // OPTIONAL - shown if present
  function: "Provides microenvironment",   // OPTIONAL - shown if present
  quickID: "Thinnest pink layer...",       // OPTIONAL - shown if present
  cnsEquivalent: "Pia mater"               // OPTIONAL - shown in blue if present
}]
```

**CRITICAL:** ALL fields are displayed in Hierarchical and Quick Cards. Nothing is hidden.

---

### **aroundOrOutside Array (FOR ADIPOCYTES)**

```javascript
aroundOrOutside: [{
  structure: "Adipocytes",                               // REQUIRED
  description: "Large white circular spaces (negative image of lipid content); much larger than myelin profiles",  // REQUIRED
  function: "Energy storage and cushioning",             // OPTIONAL
  spotIt: "Look for large white circles..."              // OPTIONAL
}]
```

**USAGE:**
- **Hierarchical:** Shows description, function, spotIt in sublayer box under Epineurium
- **Quick Cards:** Shows description only in "FOUND WITHIN EPINEURIUM" section inside Epineurium card
- **Relationships:** Shows function in OUTSIDE FASCICLES section

---

### **insideTheFascicles Array (FOR FIBROCYTES)**

```javascript

## üí° KEY PRINCIPLES

1. **School's Essential List Order** - Always follow: Bundle ‚Üí Endo ‚Üí Peri ‚Üí Epi ‚Üí Fibrocytes
2. **Nested Children Support** - Use objects with {name, description, relationship, clinicalNote, children} for structures with nesting
3. **Adipocytes Placement** - Always in `additional` array with details in `aroundOrOutside`
4. **All Fields Displayed** - Generate complete data; nothing is hidden in Hierarchical/Quick Cards
5. **Three Formats Only** - Hierarchical, Quick Cards, Relationships (Ultra-Minimal disabled)
6. **Clean Design** - Quick Cards use white backgrounds, black text, no emojis
7. **Comprehensive Learning** - Detailed content for exam success
