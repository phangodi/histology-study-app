# MASTER PROMPT: Histology Slide Content Generation

## üìã OBJECTIVE
Generate a complete JavaScript object for a histology slide with comprehensive exam-ready content, including staining information, all layers, CNS equivalents, and common mistakes.

## üéØ INSTRUCTIONS FOR CLAUDE

### STEP 1: Read the Automation Guide
**First action:** Read `/mnt/skills/user/HISTOLOGY_AUTOMATION_GUIDE.md` OR the uploaded `HISTOLOGY_AUTOMATION_GUIDE.md` file to understand the complete schema and requirements.

### STEP 2: Identify the Slide
Search the MTO PDF (`School_s_essential_list_that_includes_all_the_slides_and_essential_structures_on_the_MTO_.pdf`) for the requested slide number to extract:
- Full slide name
- Stain type
- ALL listed structures (including sub-structures with hyphens)

### STEP 3: Find Relevant Documents
Use `OFFICIAL_MTO_DIRECTORY.md` to identify which PDF files contain information about this slide.

### STEP 4: Research Content
1. Search the identified PDF files for detailed information
2. **CRITICAL:** Use general histology knowledge to supplement if documents are incomplete
3. Ensure all mandatory elements are included (see checklist below)

### STEP 5: Generate Complete Object
Create a complete JavaScript object following the exact schema in the Automation Guide.

## üö® COMMON ERRORS TO AVOID

### ‚ùå DON'T:
- Give generic staining information (be specific to the slide!)
- Skip layers (they're mandatory!)
- Miss CNS equivalents for nervous tissue
- Forget common mistakes
- Use vague descriptions ("appears different", "varies")
- Only rely on project documents (supplement with knowledge!)
- Include layers in essentialStructures array (use layers array!)

### ‚úÖ DO:
- Be specific with colors, shapes, patterns
- Include all layers in dedicated layers array
- Always mention CNS equivalents for nerve structures
- List concrete common mistakes
- Use comparative descriptions (larger than X, similar to Y)
- Supplement project docs with general histology knowledge
- Focus on practical exam identification

## üí° REMEMBER

**The goal is EXAM SUCCESS, not academic perfection.**
- Focus on practical identification
- Include high-yield information
- Make it comprehensive enough to pass the exam
- Don't just transcribe project documents - ADD essential knowledge!

**Quality over speed:**
- Take time to ensure completeness
- Double-check all mandatory elements
- Verify CNS equivalents for nerve structures
- Confirm all layers are included

**Consistency is key:**
- Every slide should be equally comprehensive
- Follow the same pattern every time
- Maintain the same level of detail
