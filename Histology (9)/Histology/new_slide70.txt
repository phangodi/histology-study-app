    whatItStainsInThisSlide: [
      "Schwann cell nuclei → Dark purple/blue (heterochromatic)",
      "Fibrocyte nuclei (in endoneurium) → Purple/blue elongated",
      "Axoplasm → Pale pink (when visible)",
      "Endoneurium collagen → Light pink delicate fibers",
      "Perineurium layers → Pink concentric lamellae (2-6 layers)",

    keyEmphasis: "The diagnostic honeycomb pattern results from myelin lipids being dissolved during tissue processing, leaving only white circular/oval spaces around axons. This negative image is the hallmark of HE-stained peripheral nerves and distinguishes it from OsO₄ staining where myelin appears black."

  // ========== COMPARISON WITH OTHER STAINS ==========
  comparisonWithOtherStains: {
    "HE (this slide)": "Myelin = WHITE (dissolved), Axon = pink dot, Nuclei = purple. Best for: seeing all 3 CT layers and overall architecture",
    "OsO₄ (Slide 72)": "Myelin = BLACK (lipids stained), Axon = white/unstained. Best for: visualizing myelin directly and assessing myelination",
    "Ag (Silver)": "Axons = BLACK, Myelin = unstained. Best for: tracing axonal pathways and nerve fiber distribution"
  },

  // ========== COMMON MISTAKES ==========
  commonMistakes: [
    {
      mistake: "Thinking white spaces are adipocytes",
      correction: "Adipocytes are MUCH larger, located in epineurium (between fascicles), and lack the surrounding Schwann cell nuclei. Myelin spaces are uniform small circles arranged in organized fascicles."
    },
    {
      mistake: "Confusing perineurium with blood vessel walls",
      correction: "Perineurium forms complete concentric rings around entire fascicle with multiple cell layers; blood vessels are circular with single-layered walls and contain red blood cells in lumen."
    },
    {
      mistake: "Thinking myelin should be pink/stained with HE",
      correction: "CRITICAL: HE dissolves lipids during processing! Myelin appears as WHITE/CLEAR space (negative image). Only OsO₄ or myelin-specific stains show myelin directly."
    },
    {
      mistake: "Missing the three-layer organization",
      correction: "Always identify all three layers (endo/peri/epi-neurium) and relate to CNS equivalents (pia/arachnoid/dura). This is essential for exams!"
    },
    {
      mistake: "Confusing cross section with longitudinal section",
      correction: "Cross section = circular honeycomb pattern, NO wavy appearance, NO visible nodes of Ranvier. Longitudinal = wavy pink strands with elongated white spaces."
    }

  // ========== CLINICAL CORRELATIONS ==========
  clinicalCorrelations: [
    {
      condition: "Guillain-Barré Syndrome",
      relevance: "Autoimmune demyelination: honeycomb pattern would show fewer/thinner white rings as myelin sheaths are destroyed; Schwann cells affected"
    },
    {
      condition: "Diabetic Neuropathy",
      relevance: "Chronic hyperglycemia damages endoneurial blood vessels and disrupts blood-nerve barrier; leads to axonal degeneration visible as fewer intact nerve fibers"
    },
    {
      condition: "Nerve Compression/Entrapment",
      relevance: "Chronic pressure damages myelin and axons; histology shows disorganized fascicles, thickened perineurium, and infiltration of epineurium with fibrosis"
    },
    {
      condition: "Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease",
      relevance: "Hereditary demyelinating neuropathy: shows 'onion bulb' formation (concentric Schwann cell proliferation) around axons, visible in cross sections"
    }
  ],

  // ========== FUNCTIONAL CONTEXT ==========
  functionalContext: {
    nerveComposition: "Mixed peripheral nerves contain: (1) Motor axons (α and γ-motor neurons) - myelinated, innervate skeletal muscle; (2) Sensory axons (pseudounipolar neurons) - myelinated and unmyelinated, carry sensation; (3) Autonomic axons (sympathetic/parasympathetic) - typically unmyelinated, control visceral functions",
    myelinationSignificance: "Myelin sheath (formed by Schwann cells wrapping axon) enables saltatory conduction, increasing conduction velocity 10-100x. Larger diameter + more myelin = faster conduction. Unmyelinated fibers conduct more slowly.",
    bloodNerveBarrier: "Perineurium tight junctions create blood-nerve barrier (analogous to blood-brain barrier), regulating nerve fiber microenvironment. Protects from toxins, maintains ion gradients essential for nerve function.",
    regenerationPotential: "PNS axons can regenerate (unlike CNS) because: (1) Schwann cells survive and provide guidance, (2) Endoneurium provides scaffold, (3) Growth factors secreted. Speed: ~1mm/day in humans."
  },

  // ========== SIZE REFERENCE ==========
  sizeReference: {
    axonDiameter: "1-20 μm (larger = faster conduction)",
    myelinThickness: "Proportional to axon diameter; typically myelin:axon ratio ~0.6:1",
    fascicleWidth: "100-1000 μm depending on nerve size",
    perineuriumThickness: "5-20 μm (2-6 cell layers)",
    epineuriumThickness: "Variable; thicker in large nerves; 10-50% of nerve diameter",
    nerveSize: "Total peripheral nerve trunk can be 1-10+ mm in diameter"
  },

  // ========== EXAM TIPS ==========
  examTips: [
    "If you see honeycomb pattern with white holes = HE-stained peripheral nerve cross section (Slide 70)",
    "Always describe all THREE layers (endoneurium, perineurium, epineurium) and their CNS equivalents",
    "Mention 'negative image of myelin' and explain lipids dissolved during HE preparation",
    "Identify Schwann cell nuclei at periphery of myelin spaces (distinguishes PNS from CNS)",
    "Count and describe fascicles - mention variable sizes indicating mixed nerve fiber types",
    "Don't confuse adipocytes (large, in epineurium) with myelin spaces (small, in fascicles)",
    "Compare with Slide 72 (OsO₄) where myelin is BLACK, not white"
